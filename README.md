Pandas Profiling to automate Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
https://www.youtube.com/@Bioinformatics_Made_Easy

Pandas Profiling enables fast and automated exploratory data analysis (EDA) with just a few lines of code. 

It's an excellent starting point for data exploration and the AutoML workflow. 

The tool generates a comprehensive, easy-to-read report directly from a pandas DataFrame, summarizing variable types, distributions, correlations, ranges, and missing values. While it's not a substitute for the depth of analysis a skilled data scientist can provide, it's a valuable resource for quickly understanding the structure and quality of a dataset.
